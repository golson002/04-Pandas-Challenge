# PyCitySchools Pandas Exercise

## **Motivation/Reason for Analysis:**

The motivation for the analysis of the school and student data sets in the PyCitySchools exercise was to assess proficiency with Pandas and to understand my ability to take large data sets, merge them into one data set based on shared data, turn the merged data set into smaller, more pointed data sets or DataFrames, and finally group/parse those DataFrames to effectively summarize and display trends in the data.

In this exercise, I assumed the postion/perspective of the Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity's school district with the intention here to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Using the district-wide standardized test results and information on every student's math and reading scores and the schools they attend, my goal is to parse the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. The trends in school performance will likely inform the board's decision on the disctrict's schools budgets and priorities moving forward.
